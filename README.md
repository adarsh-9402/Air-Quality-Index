# Air-Quality-Index
This project aims to develop a predictive model for estimating the Air Quality Index (AQI) using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) ML algorithm. AQI is a standardized indicator used to measure and report air pollution levels, which helps assess health risks associated with air quality.

# Main Features Of The Project:
<b></b>->Air Quality Data Preprocessing:</b>
 Handles missing values, data normalization, and categorical AQI label encoding.
 Uses real pollutant concentration data as input features.

<b></b>->KNN-Based Classification:</b>
 Classifies AQI levels into standard categories (e.g., Good, Satisfactory, Poor, etc.).
 Adjustable 'K' parameter to optimize model accuracy.

<b></b>->Performance Evaluation:</b>
 Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall.
 Visualization tools to interpret model behavior and classification results.

<b></b>->Interactive Visualization:</b>
 Graphs showing pollutant trends, AQI distribution, and prediction outcomes.
 Could be integrated into a web-based dashboard using Streamlit or Flask.

<b></b>->Modular Code Design:</b>
 Separate modules for data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
 Easy to upgrade or replace with other machine learning algorithms later.

<b></b>->Scalable for Real-time Use:</b>
 Framework allows integration with real-time air sensor APIs for live AQI forecasting (in extended versions).
