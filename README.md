# Air-Quality-Index
This project aims to develop a predictive model for estimating the Air Quality Index (AQI) using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) ML algorithm. AQI is a standardized indicator used to measure and report air pollution levels, which helps assess health risks associated with air quality.
